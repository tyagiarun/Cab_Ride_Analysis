# Cab_Ride_Analysis

- In this project, we have architected and built a solution to cater to the following requirements:
- Booking data analytics solution: This is a feature in which the ride-booking data is stored in a way such that it is available for all types of analytics   without hampering business. These analyses mostly include daily, weekly and monthly booking counts as well as booking counts by the mobile operating       system, average booking amount, total tip amount, etc.
- Clickstream data analytics solution: Clickstream is the application browsing data that is generated on every action taken by the user on the app. This     includes link click, button click, screen load, etc. This is relevant to know the userâ€™s intent and then take action to engage them more in the app         according to their browsing behaviour. Since this is very high-volume data (more than the bookings data), it needs to be architectured quite well and       stored in a proper format for analysis.
